# 📟 Retro Terminal Portfolio — MD. Raiyan Bin Rafique

> A fully immersive, 3D-rendered **Commodore PET 8296-style** terminal portfolio. Built from scratch with Three.js and a custom WebGL text engine — no canvas 2D, no HTML overlays. Everything you see on that screen is rendered in real-time WebGL.

## ✨ What Is This?

This is my personal portfolio — presented as a **functional retro terminal** running inside a 3D-rendered vintage computer. Instead of a conventional website with cards and carousels, visitors interact with a simulated Bash-like shell to explore my resume, projects, and contact details.

You type commands. The terminal responds. Everything is rendered live in WebGL.

## 🕹️ Terminal Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `ls` | List directories/files in current folder |
| `cd <dir>` | Change directory (e.g. `cd projects`) |
| `cat <file>` | Render a markdown file (e.g. `cat about.md`) |
| `pwd` | Print current working directory |
| `help` | Show all available commands |
| `clear` | Clear the terminal screen |

## ⚙️ What We Built & Fixed

This project went through several rounds of deep technical refinement:

### ✅ Custom WebGL Text Engine
- Built a character-by-character glyph renderer using `TextGeometry` merged into a single draw call per frame
- Implemented word-wrap, multi-font support (h1/h2/h3/p), and inline markdown rendering
- Designed a scroll system tracking `totalContentHeight` vs. `logicalScreenHeight` for accurate scroll bounds

### ✅ Terminal Interaction Layer
- Full keyboard input pipeline: character insertion, deletion, caret navigation via Arrow keys
- On `Enter`: `freezeInput()` bakes typed characters into the static text mesh, clears the dynamic `inputBuffer`, and resets coordinate state for the next prompt
- `scrollToEnd()` called after every command so the new prompt is always visible

### ✅ Bug Fixes
| Bug | Fix |
|---|---|
| Ghost text ("ls" overlapping output) | `rootGroup.remove(c)` instead of `sceneRTT.remove(c)` — characters live in `rootGroup` |
| Output colliding with command | `placeMarkdown()` now always calls `placeLinebreak()` before rendering |
| Caret invisible after command | `yBefore` captured before linebreak so full height is tracked in `totalContentHeight` |
| Arrow Down couldn't reach prompt | Fixed `maxScroll = totalContentHeight - logicalScreenHeight` calculation |
| Caret drifting right | `charNextLoc.x = 0` reset in both `freezeInput()` and `placeText()` |
